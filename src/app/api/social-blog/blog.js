The matter will be heard in court now on May 27. Tamanna also pointed out that from children to the elderly they are playing with the lives of everyone, and the promotion of such brands by these actors will have a very bad effect on the children as they may also start doing all these things.<br/>While Amitabh Bachchan withdrew from a Paan Masala Ad and Akshay Kumar stepped down as a Brand Ambassador of a Company that has Tobacco products, it seems some of the other actors have not really cared about criticism at large which is strange, especially after the Boycott Bollywood trend that has been going on since the passing of Sushant Singh Rajput whose demise was widely criticized as being a result of group boycotting & outcasting from some of the big movie producers thus, it may be a way for these actors to recuperate from financial losses or aspirations so much so that none of the criticism looks big enough.<br/>We have been saying the same over a few videos in recent times especially when Akshay Kumar joined this gang who later also apologized that the stardom that these actors have comes with a lot of responsibility especially when their influence is hard-hitting on people from lower tiers in India who will easily get manipulated as these ads are mere brand recall campaigns for the parent brand which is of pan masala which has more than 80% market share and is the primary source of revenue for the companies and that’s the only reason, these actors are paid in crores and an excuse that they are only selling Elaichi is a big farce.`,

Songs with the likes of ‘mehengai daayan’ from a movie Peepli LIVE and another lately trending on social media were used to mask the voice of a 7-year-old.

However, Kamra confronted him tweeting “The video is in the public domain by a news organization.” An accommodating and receptive response could have settled the matter in the blink of an eye.<br/>The tweet was not taken back until the National Council for Protection of Child Rights stepped into the picture, promptly reacting to the complaints lodged in light of the issue. “Using minors for political ideologies is a violation of the provisions of Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 and the Information Technology Rules, 2021.”- the circular by NCPCR, dated 5.5.2022 commented. It also expressed its apprehensions about the toll such videos might take on the impressionable minds of minors. Today is the time for setting examples and not opinions, and the proactive approach by the council has stood up to this.<br/>We breathe in a thriving democracy and questioning the government is a right each one of us proudly boasts. It is the means which distinguishes two persons condemning the same system, and not the end. Kunal has repeatedly used comedy and satire as a tool to mirror the shortfalls of the government. This resonates with the central idea of democracy and is justified in all proportions. But the bone of contention lies in the path he chooses.`,

        p: `These were the tear-soaked words of the aging father of Karan Raju, who lost his life in a hit-and-run accident on Monday, the 16th of May. Karan had dived into the Zepto delivery space only recently, to keep his family financially afloat, especially at a time when his sister’s wedding was coming up. Karan was completing a delivery close to his own home and following all traffic protocols when an unidentified vehicle smashed into his bike. He was rushed to Safdarjung hospital but eventually succumbed to his critical injuries. He was 19 years old.<br/>Karan’s tragic story comes at a time when ‘instant delivery’ has become a buzzword in the delivery space. While companies like Zepto have their very roots in this flawed concept, Zomato fell into deep public trouble when it announced it was going to follow suit.<br/>The logic is bluntly simple. A 10-minute or an unreasonably short delivery window is a bane masked in the image of speed. It throws the life of delivery agents into immeasurable risk and threatens the quality of goods being delivered. It’s a loss-loss game for all, except the companies who’ll fight tooth and nail for publicity and profits.<br/>The gig economy is one that involves temporary, freelancing, and flexible jobs and has caught steam with the arrival of apps such as Ola and Zomato. Let us first understand how the wheels of this Gig economy turn. There are certainly more skeletons in the closet adding to the doom of instant delivery.`,

Many have shed light on the non-existent or rarely functional lines of communication with their employer. The gig economy is slowly hammering its own backbone.<br/>One of the victims was Karan, in the sea of thousands more who are trapped by the bait of high incomes which these companies churn out by burning cash on marketing. Almost always, the bubble bursts as these companies stealthily reduce the incentives which form the majority of the workers’ income. Hollow promises often buy the voices of the sufferers.<br/>A common sight is many unsuspecting youngsters buying a vehicle on loan for the purpose of driving or otherwise. Since they were unable to make even ends meet during the pandemic, they had to borrow intensively to pay the earlier loans too. Thus, caught in a debt trap, they had nothing to look up to but a dark future. With no dedicated law in place, millions in India today are hanging by a thread. Things need to change. Companies sucking profits off the well-being of workers will not be accepted. Period.`,

There are psychological and physiological reasons as to why this occurs. Eating certain foods high in nutrients may help improve mood while foods low in nutritional value and high in sugar may be a hinderance to one’s mood. Eating a whole foods plant based diet can help stabilize blood sugar levels, resulting in a reduction of sugar cravings as well as alcohol cravings. Maintaining a healthy nutritional lifestyle is a form of self-care and is indicative of caring about your wellbeing, in which case you will be more inclined to care about your sobriety.<br/>But different things work for different people and it’s important you find the way that works for you and only when the time is right and you’ve learnt to live your life confidently and happily sober. As discussed above, sugar can be as addictive as alcohol for some people. Excessive consumption of fructose sweeteners, for example, can lead to fatty liver disease—just like alcohol.<br/>Using a functional MRI scanner, researchers found that the same part of the brain lights up every time an individual drinks alcohol or eats sugar. People who are dependent on sugar can experience withdrawal-like symptoms when they try to give it up. These include anxiety, shaking, and obsessively thinking about sugary foods.

A person struggling with a substance abuse problem needs to eat well for their body and mind. Proper nutrition gives the individual much-needed energy, making them feel better mentally, physically, and emotionally. A positive mood is also affected by proper nutrition because it can positively affect an individual’s outlook on life–lessening the risk of relapse in some cases.

This association appears to be at least partially under genetic control, and there are indications that the genetic component of this association is stronger than the component related to environmental factors. However, the specific genes controlling consumption of both alcohol and sweet substances have not been identified.<br/>The loss of the dopamine rush from drugs can cause the brain to crave a substitute, such as sugary foods that produce dopamine. Contemporary research has shown that a high number of alcohol-dependent and other drug-dependent individuals have a sweet preference, specifically for foods with a high sucrose concentration. The neurobiological pathways of drug and “sugar addiction” involve similar neural receptors, neurotransmitters, and hedonic regions in the brain. Craving, tolerance, withdrawal and sensitization have been documented in both human and animal studies.<br/>1. Dulan lists hard-boiled eggs, avocado toast, protein balls, and almonds as a few of her favorite “cravings busters.” Frozen grapes, which she says “taste like a mini sorbet,” are another good option.<br/>2.

In recovery, many alcoholics find that they have a new and unquenchable urge for the sweet stuff.<br/>4.

Despite sugar initially boosting serotonin levels in the brain, sugar can worsen anxiety as sugar lows create feelings of fatigue and depression. Overcoming alcohol addiction requires strength, determination, and commitment.<br/>The problem is that poor nutrition can lead to a variety of mental and physical health issues. Weight gain is a common problem for those new to recovery from alcohol addiction, and subsequently can lead to low mood which may then trigger a relapse to alcohol. At that time the individual’s mindset can become, “when I was drinking I wasn’t eating all this food.” The alcohol numbed their depression and quieted their negative thoughts about their self-image. These spikes and crashes make sugar cravings incredibly common in early recovery from alcohol use disorder. People who abruptly stop drinking may lose a significant source of their calorie intake and have disrupted their body’s blood sugar regulation. Additionally, people who suffer from constant tiredness may reach for carb-rich sugary foods for a boost.`,

        p: `If you do find yourself reaching for the sugar initially, your clothes might get tighter and you might feel like you haven’t got things quite right yet and that’s okay – give yourself a break. Having a short love affair with sugar is still healthier for you than if you had carried on drinking. When you’ve dealt with the drinking, you can deal with nutrition and eating healthily. It is important to eat healthy snacks like fresh fruit, vegetables, low fat cheese or nuts to keep yourself satisfied. This will help increase your metabolic rate, and will keep you feeling good about yourself. So be sure to start your day with a healthy substantial breakfast, and supplement this with healthy snacks to keep your cravings in check.<br/>That’s what makes it so difficult to resist urges and cravings.

Last year, after a couple of weeks, I was back to my old ways without thinking much about my sober experience. However, addiction research has shown there could be deeper biological link than that.

Let’s have a sneak peek.<br/>In an interview with Kareena Kapoor Khan, Ajey clearly had to bear the brunt of being a YouTuber and not a flashy Bollywood celebrity. Being an anchor, it is a bare minimum to know who you’re interviewing. Kareena, however, dismissed Carry as “she finally knew who he actually was” and that “she had only heard of him before”. Ajey still took it all in good humor, and let it be.<br/>In a later incident, Bollywood zeroed out a way to correct its own image by approaching Carry Minati to use his reputed song “Yalgaar” in a recently released film. Any sane person could tell they were riding on Ajey’s concrete follower base. Runway 34 also featured his cameo.`,

Third, their derogatory behaviour with some YouTube stars says more than their perfectly scripted words.<br/>YouTubers like Carry Minati don’t have followers – they have a family. As long as they have that by their shoulder, along with a passion and purpose, they are a force to reckon. If the cost is more than the benefit, it is better to pass the investment. That’s the rule of finance, and that’s the rule of life. Head to Peepoye’s comprehensive take on the story!<br/>After all, as Sherlock Holmes put it, “It’s elementary, my dear Watson.”`,

The 55-year-old said the physics and chemistry questions were simple, and he anticipates getting around 460 points. If he is offered a spot in any government medical college, he intends to pursue his ambition of becoming a doctor.<br/>Rajyakkodi, a resident of Ambattaiyanpatti village, qualified for the tests and applied for admission to a private medical college in 1984, but he was unable to enrol in the programme due to financial constraints. He decided to leave the Pasumpon Thevar Arts and Science College in Usilampatti town’s BSc Physics programme in the future due to the family’s financial struggles.<br/>Even decades later, Rajyakkodi was still motivated to pursue his dreams after learning that a 64-year-old man from Odisha had recently been accepted into a medical institution, despite several obstacles and disappointments. This drive provided him the determination to put in at least three hours a day of hard effort to reach his objective.<br/>His younger son R Vasudevan, who scored 521 points in his NEET second try and was offered a spot in the MBBS programme at the Government Medical College in Cuddalore, is his another source of encouragement. Rajyakkodi studied for the exam during the course of the previous year using his son’s study materials, and he took a number of practise exams to boost his confidence.`,

People still seem unable to stop throwing rubbish into the ocean in spite of various awareness efforts, recommendations, and laws. Most individuals aren’t even aware of the harm they inflict.<br/>A video of the incident at Mumbai Beach in India recently went popular on Twitter. According to India Today, it has received over 78,000 views, a tonne of comments, and hundreds of retweets and depicts the terrible truth.<br/>An aerial image of Mumbai’s Mahim beach, which is littered, can be seen in a video shared on the Mumbaimatterz Twitter account on July 16.<br/>“Citizens throng Mahim beach to have a look at the return gift from the Arabian Sea.”, the caption read.<br/>The comment area was filled with thoughts from angry netizens. The necessity for strict laws to stop plastic pollution was a topic of much discussion. Others requested a substantial fine for people who violate the rules. In response to the uploaded video, internet users vented their rage on Twitter.<br/>Later, the profile also published a post showing how the government organised a clean-up effort to clear the debris that had accumulated at the beach saying thanks to them for their fabulous job.<br/>Every year, millions of tonnes of plastic are produced using fossil fuels. Once the plastic enters the environment, the fragments strangle marine life and the food chain.`,

(a UHG company), Gurgaon, committed suicide due to the sexual allegations placed on him by a female colleague, Archana. On 19th august 2022, Amit attended a meeting by the company in which he was accused of sexual harassment which was followed by his committing suicide the next day. What happened in the meeting remains unknown as no record is to be found of the same. Similarly, what Amit went through mentally in the meeting is also taken along with him. He committed suicide by hanging himself with his wife’s dupatta. His suicide left his wife shattered and a 5-year-old child without a father.<br/>He left a 5 pages suicide note penning down the allegations put before him which he condemns to be false. Still, To the date, there is no movement in the case. No proceeding has been taken from the company’s side. For a week, the company didn’t feel a need to speak to the grieving family.<br/>The following were the allegations put before Amit as per his suicide note:<br/>1. He asked about Archana’s father’s retirement<br/>2. He requested for a change in the roaster<br/>3. He used to call her to reprimand her about her cab delays<br/>Where does the above allegations suggests a “sexual” harassment is a question before the people of sane and rational thinking.<br/>He was a simple and responsible family man who was excited about his son’s upcoming birthday. Many people attack Amit for being weak because of his suicide but what his wife reveals can not be sidelined either. According to her, Amit was preparing for his son’s upcoming birthday party the previous day, and the very next day he hanged himself which is an unacceptable step for her wife, and therefore she could not get over the fact of his husband’s suicide.<br/>Feminist steps for one woman ruined the life of another, Is this what feminism is? Isn’t feminism about supporting and uplifting women towards a welfare state? Is this what feminism does to a “man” who is trying to build a career for himself and provide the best he could for his family? Amit’s wife has outworn her shoes to seek justice for her husband. His family is still trying to seek justice but there is yet no help from either Gurgaon Police or the management of Optum Global Solution. To help a person get his basic human rights, contribute by sharing the story till it reaches the door of justice and join our change community.`,

Bigg Boss has always come into controversies for being a scripted show. However, it also successfully rises at the top in the news because of the same controversial topics. This time in Big Boss 16, Filmmaker Sajid Khan's entry into the house made a lot of controversies outside. Many celebrities who accused Sajid during the MeToo movement raised their voice and asked for his removal from the show.<br/>This season is special because Bigg Boss makers have played an active role though Bigg Boss voice from time-to-time in the show, but today we will not talk about that humor or advice it brings in the show or for the contestants, but the godfather role makers played helping Sajid Khan improve his image outside. They further solidified Sajid’s position in the house quite tactfully by getting most loved contestant Abdu Rozik in the show in his corner from the day 1.<br/>Even though MC Stan has his own record label called Hindi records, Bigg Boss chose Sajid as a translator for Abdu Rozik so that Sajid can garner support from Abdu’s fandom. This was critical initially to neutralized the anger for bigboss fans against Sajid casting. Today we’ll uncover some facts about white washing machine manufactured by Bigboss makers and Team Sajid.`,

He would get offended easily when someone would talk to him in a loud voice even when he would do the same.

If we look into the data, Sajid was nominated in four weeks- Week 1, 9, 11 & 14 but each of that week, he got nominated, but no one evicted from the house which never happened in the Bigg Boss history.`,

These genuine spiritual leaders have dedicated their lives to serving others and have helped to create a world that is more harmonious & peaceful.<br/>On the other hand, there are also some fake spiritual leaders who exploit people's faith and devotion for their own benefit. These individuals have often presented themselves as holy men or gurus, claiming to have divine powers and special connections to the divine. However, their true intentions have often been to manipulate and deceive others for personal gain, whether it be for power, wealth, or control.<br/>These spiritual leaders are not limited to any one particular religion. Across all religions, there have been instances of individuals claiming to be spiritual gurus or holy men who use their positions of authority to manipulate and exploit others.

This has made him popular on social media and many videos of him have been shared on Twitter. He says that he writes what comes to his mind and it always turns out to be true. He also says that the people of Bageshwar Dham will fight back against those trying to harm his reputation.<br/>Bageshwar Baba has received support from various leaders, including BJP's Kailash Vijayvargiya, who says he is being attacked for speaking against love jihad. However, the Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh, Bhupesh Baghel, has challenged baba to fix the problem in Joshimath if he really has magical powers. He said, "If he's so powerful, he should solve the Joshimath problem." A video of the baba also has been shared on social media, and it shows him calling a journalist from the crowd and sharing information about the journalist's family members, which left the journalist shocked. In our research, we found that the information shared by Bageshwar baba about the journalist was already present in the journalist's Facebook profile.

Manav addressed a press conference on January 9th, where he challenged the self-proclaimed godman to demonstrate his claimed "Divya Shakti" (divine power) and offered a cash reward of Rs 30 lakh for proof.<br/>Nagpur CP Amitesh Kumar said, "Based on the complaint lodged against Bageshwar Maharaj by Manav and a video submitted by him as evidence, police conducted an inquiry into the matter. However, it was found that the programme held by Maharaj in Nagpur does not attract action under any of these laws."`,

        p: `The science behind mind-reading, also known as Mentalism, is based on psychology, sociology, and perception principles. Mentalists use techniques such as cold reading, body language analysis, and suggestions to give the illusion of mind-reading. Cold reading involves using general statements to gather information about the subject, while body language analysis helps to detect subtle cues that can indicate thoughts and emotions. The suggestion is used to plant ideas in the subject's mind, making them think they are being read. While mind-reading may seem like magic, it is based on scientific principles and techniques that can be mastered with practice. However, it's important to note that mind-reading is not an actual psychic ability, and mentalists rely on their skills and knowledge to create the illusion.`,

As a result, many treatments for hysteria involved religious rituals like exorcisms.<br/>Hysteria is a term that was historically used to describe a wide range of symptoms that were believed to be caused by psychological or emotional distress. The term has largely fallen out of use in modern medicine, but it was once thought to be a common condition, particularly among women. Hysteria was characterised by symptoms such as fainting, trembling, and uncontrollable laughter or crying, and it was believed to be caused by a "wandering womb" or an overactive imagination.<br/>In modern times, the science of psychology and psychiatry has advanced to the point where hysteria is no longer considered a valid medical diagnosis. The symptoms that were once attributed to hysteria are now understood to be the result of a variety of physical and psychological conditions, including neurological disorders, stress, and trauma.`,

While religion and spirituality can provide comfort and guidance, it's crucial to differentiate between genuine spiritual leaders and those who exploit people's faith for personal gain. The science of mentalism shows that mind-reading and other so-called miraculous abilities can be explained through psychological and sociological principles rather than divine intervention. Therefore, it's essential to question and critically examine such claims and to seek evidence and verification before placing trust in any individual. Blind faith can lead to harm, both to individuals and communities, and it's important to approach spiritual leaders and beliefs with a healthy dose of scepticism and critical thinking.`,

        p: `Pakistan is currently facing a grave economic crisis with rising inflation, depleting foreign exchange reserves, and dependence on imports. In May 2022, the government took measures to control inflation and stabilise the economy, including banning the import of luxury items, lifting the cap on fuel prices, and reducing tea consumption. Despite these efforts, the country continues to struggle with inflation reaching 21.3% in June, the highest since 2008. Additionally, the 2022 summer floods resulted in over $30 billion in economic losses, further exacerbating the crisis.<br/>The depreciation of the rupee and the consistent decline of the State Bank of Pakistan’s reserves are also contributing to the economic turmoil. In January 2023, even the CEO of Pakistan's largest bank commented on the dire situation, warning of a potential collapse if swift action is not taken. The government unveiled a new federal budget in June 2022. Still, with the current debt at 247 billion dollars and only 3.7 billion in foreign exchange reserves, the 6 billion bailouts from the IMF may not be enough to save the country from economic collapse. Let's dive deep into the situation and explore the reasons behind this crisis and possible solutions to overcome it.`,

        h1: `The reason behind Pakistan worsening economic crisis`,
        h2: false,
        p: `The Pakistani economy has been pushed to a perilous state due to a multitude of reasons, each of which has its own significant impact. Let's take a closer look at each one of these reasons and understand why they have led to the current state of the Pakistani economy.<br/><strong className="font-medium text-neutral-800">Debt:</strong> Pakistan's total external debt stocks have increased to $130.433 billion by end-2021 from $115.695 by end-2020, as reported by the World Bank. The country's external debt reached $126.9 billion in September 2022, according to CEIC data. Currently, Pakistan's debt-to-GDP ratio is in a danger zone of 70 percent, with 40-50 percent of government revenue earmarked for interest payments this year, according to Reuters. Out of the country's $27 billion in bilateral debt, approximately $23 billion is made up of Chinese loans, as reported by Mint.<br/><strong className="font-medium text-neutral-800">Inflation:</strong> Inflation in Pakistan was at a 48-year-high in January, as thousands of containers of food items, raw materials, and equipment are stuck in ports after the cash-strapped government curtailed imports, as reported by Bloomberg. The inflation rate worsened to 27.55 percent recently. Higher inflation has a depressing effect on the value of a country's currency, as it reduces the currency's buying power and weakens it against other currencies. This brings us to the concern about the Pakistani rupee.<br/><strong className="font-medium text-neutral-800">The Pakistani Rupee:</strong> The Pakistani rupee fell 9.6 percent against the dollar on January 26, the biggest one-day drop in over two decades, which may persuade the International Monetary Fund to resume lending to the country, according to Reuters. Last week, Pakistan removed an artificial cap on the rupee, resulting in it losing 14.73 percent in interbank trading during the last three trading sessions.<br/><strong className="font-medium text-neutral-800">Foreign Exchange Reserves:</strong> In January of this year, Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves dropped to $4.3 billion, the lowest since 2014, according to an Aljazeera report. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) announced this after paying off some of the country's external debt payments. Commercial banks hold $5.8 billion, totalling nearly $10.1 billion, and the total liquid foreign reserves held by the country stood at $9.45 billion as of January 20, 2023, according to the SBP report.<br/><strong className="font-medium text-neutral-800">Political Crises:</strong> It is believed that constant political chaos may undermine a coherent and timely policy response. No Pakistani PM has completed a full five-year term in office, and the current government's tenure will end in August, enabling a special caretaker government to take charge for up to 90 days in a bid to ensure free and fair elections. However, the caretaker government is not empowered to sign an IMF (International Monetary Fund) pact, raising the question of whether the government and opposition can cooperate on a joint pledge to push through any IMF demands in order to avert a default, as reported by Reuters.<br/><strong className="font-medium text-neutral-800">Shortage of Power and Energy:</strong> Pakistan is highly import-dependent, particularly with regard to energy, which renders it acutely vulnerable to hikes in global oil and gas prices, according to John Ciorciari, Professor and Associate Dean for Research and Policy Engagement at the University of Michigan. The recent massive outage has added to the country's woes. Although Pakistan has enough installed power capacity, it lacks the resources to run its oil-and-gas-powered plants, which are heavily in debt and cannot afford to invest in infrastructure and power lines. The crisis has forced the government to order shopping malls and markets to close by 8.30 pm for energy conservation purposes, according to an IANS report.<br/><strong className="font-medium text-neutral-800">Devastating floods:</strong> Pakistan's economy was in the process of recovering from the effects of COVID-19. To make matters worse, recent devastating floods have further delayed the much-needed economic adjustment in the country. The World Bank has stated that the economic impacts of the floods might have delayed the "much-needed economic adjustment" and that the growth in Pakistan's economy is expected to reach only around 2 per cent in FY23.<br/><strong className="font-medium text-neutral-800">Tense relations with India:</strong> The strained relations between Pakistan and India continue to hinder the country's potential for growth through transformative trade and investment partnerships. Despite a slight increase in bilateral trade, reaching $514 million in 2021-2022 according to the Ministry of Commerce, Indian exports still outweigh imports from Pakistan. Unfortunately, terrorism originating from territories under Pakistani control remains a significant issue in their relationship, as stated by the Ministry of Commerce in 2020. This ongoing tension between the two nations continues to hinder their potential for economic prosperity and stability.`,

This has led to the country's accumulation of debt to countries like China and Saudi Arabia, with its largest creditor now having a total exposure of over $25 billion. Additionally, the utilization of monetary policy through interest rate hikes and a focus on the exchange rate as a solution have proven to be ineffective, with little to no impact on aggregate demand, inflation, or real output.<br/>Pakistan's current economic crisis requires immediate action to both stop the continued loss of foreign exchange reserves and the devaluation of the rupee, as well as to address the fundamental reasons for these recurring issues. The conventional thinking of local and foreign experts has failed to bring about real change, and it's time to look towards more innovative solutions to get the country's economy back on track.`,

Shalin and Tine Dutta tried to make a fake love angle, and Tina Dutta also tried to be friends with MC stan for his fame, but Stan understood the situation very well. However, what these contestants failed to realize is that the audience is watching every detail, and they can never resonate with acting in a reality show. While these actions may have boosted ratings temporarily, they also left a sour taste in the mouths of many viewers.

This type of fraud can be executed in several ways, including Skimming, Phishing, Database Breaches and many more.<br/>Initially, through the dark web, the stolen credit card numbers are acquired by brokers in bulk and then sold to individuals who engage in carding fraud, referred to as carders. The price for a valid credit card can vary based on several factors, such as the amount of information available with the card, the type of card, and the known credit limits. Some carding brokers offer guarantees on the validity of the cards and will provide a replacement if it is blocked, which can be perceived as a form of customer service.<br/>In the Indian gaming community, carding fraud is executed through the use of YouTube's Super Chat feature. This feature allows viewers to pay for their messages to be highlighted and displayed prominently during live streams. Criminals use this feature to make fraudulent purchases by using someone else's credit or debit card information. The money generated through these fraudulent purchases is then laundered through the gaming community, making it difficult to track and recover.`,

Unfortunately, these efforts are often met with intimidation and bullying tactics aimed at silencing those who are speaking out.<br/>These tactics can range from online harassment and hate speech to physical threats and violence. Such behavior not only undermines the efforts of those working to combat carding fraud, but it also has a chilling effect on free speech and the ability of individuals to raise their voices on important issues.<br/>A few months back A youtube Gamer Paras Official, with over 1.1M+ subscribers on YouTube, recently spoke out against the use of carding in a video. Paras's stance on the issue attracted the attention of high-ranking gamers, one of whom, "Daku," engaged in a conversation with him. Unfortunately, this interaction turned violent and resulted in Paras being physically assaulted by 7 to 8 individuals. While Paras named "Daku" as one of the attackers, the accused has denied any involvement in the incident. To know more watch the video below.<br/>In recent days, a YouTuber named Hardscope has brought attention to the issue of carding fraud in the gaming community. In a video, he accused the parents of another YouTuber of being involved in this illegal activity. As a result, Hardscope has faced persistent calls from the accused parties and prominent gaming community organizers, urging him to remove his video. This has resulted in harassment and warnings for Hardscope, highlighting the tension and controversy surrounding this issue.`,

        p: `The responsibility of a parent towards their child's well-being is a crucial one, and it extends to all aspects of their development, including their exposure to media and technology. With the rise of online gaming, many parents are allowing their children to play games that are rated 18+ in the name of their career. However, it's important to understand that these games often contain mature content, violence, and other adult themes that can have a negative impact on a child's mental and emotional well-being.<br/>Studies have shown that exposure to violent media can lead to increased aggression, desensitization to violence, and a decline in empathy and moral reasoning in children. It's essential for parents to understand the potential consequences of exposing their children to mature content and to consider the impact it may have on their child's mental, emotional, and social development. As a parent, it's your responsibility to make informed decisions about what your child is exposed to and to ensure their well-being and safety.`,

The widespread use of YouTube's Super Chat feature to launder money obtained through fraudulent purchases is having a damaging impact on the reputation of the gaming community. Furthermore, the silencing of voices speaking out against this illegal activity, through tactics such as online harassment, hate speech, and physical violence, is unacceptable and undermines efforts to raise awareness and combat carding fraud.<br/>Additionally, it's essential for parents to understand the potential consequences of exposing their children to mature content and online gaming. As a parent, it's your responsibility to make informed decisions about what your child is exposed to and to protect them from potentially harmful content and experiences.`,

In another incident reported from Bengaluru, a software professional lost over Rs.80,000 after being lured by an online advertisement for an escort services agency.<br/>This is just two of many cases where young men are being duped of their money in the name of gigolo services.

It is a way of seeking blessings and showing humility and gratitude. In fact, scientifically speaking, the exchange of positive energy and vibrations when you take your hand and touch someone legs and the ‘aashirwaad’ on one’s head complete an energy circuit and as per Indian culture, one is advised to touch the feet of elderly, parents and the one who’s at a position of respect<br/>However, in the context of this video, the act of touching feet appears to have lost its traditional meaning and has become associated with wealth and power. This raises an important question about the values and priorities of society today. In a world where wealth and power seem to be the ultimate goal, traditional cultural practices and values are often disregarded.<br/>Touching someone's feet used to be a kind and respectful thing to do, but now it's seen as a way of showing that you are inferior to someone who is rich and has a lot of power. Quite evidenly Mukesh Ambani who’s the richest businessman in India would have provided for so many people and as a result of which, its obvious that the people would be humblingly pay their respect to Ambani’s family like Anant in this case but shockingly, Anand Ambani was seen here giving blessing to the employee who was double this age and didn’t even stop him from doing so which shows how this would be so normal for him on a day to day basis.`,

The percentage of women harassment cases during Holi is less than 1%, which leads towards the question of why we need to connect it with Holi in the first place. We should focus on changing the laws and our mindset towards women, rather than just trying to blame it on one festival.

    summary: `In recent times, Indian embassies and establishments have increasingly come under attack by Khalistan sympathizers across several countries, including the United Kingdom, the United State, Australia and Canada. These attacks are a cause for concern as they pose a threat to the safety and security of Indian officials and citizens abroad also the effectiveness of local law enforcement, as it seems easy for these miscreants to attack a sovereign embassy and yet no one has been detained so far.`,

They even painted a message that reads: “#Free Amrit Pal”.<br/>In August last year, miscreants painted Khalistan slogans on the walls of the Indian Consulate in San Francisco with “Khalistan Zindabad” slogan. The incident occurred amid the outlawed Khalistani group issuing a provocative statement in the wake of India’s 75th anniversary of independence.`,

Is it just as easy to vandalize their own building in Washington as it was to vandalize the Indian consulate in San Francisco?<br/>It is high time that the US and UK governments take strict action against the attackers and bring them to justice.

Suddenly, he started appearing as a devout Sikh with unshorn hair, a blue turban, a long beard, a steel bangle, and a small sacred dagger called a kirpan hanging from his waist. He started undertaking the Khalistan project and seeing Khalistan's dreams. During the farmer protest, Amritpal Singh started giving his extremist ideology through social media. He started engaging himself in communities and groups with similar beliefs.<br/>Deep Sidhu, another passionate advocate for the Khalistan movement, created an organization named Waris Punjab De. Amritpal and Sidhu met on Clubhouse, a social media app, where Amritpal quickly became the moderator in that group, and Deep Sidhu was leading that group. Although Deep Sidhu had a balanced ideology, Amritpal Singh had an extremist ideology.<br/>After the death of Deep Sidhu, Amritpal Singh took the lead of this organization. He continues to propagate his extremist views, promoting the Khalistan movement and its separatist agenda. While his transformation may seem sudden and unexpected, his passion for the Khalistan cause has made him a leader in the community, inspiring others to join his cause.`,

He became a similar personality, which raises questions about how his appearance changed, and whether it was based on convenience or opportunity. It is also unclear why this transformation did not occur previously and who might be influencing him now.<br/>Supporters of Singh consider him as an inspiration and compare him to Bhindranwale. Singh emulates Bhindranwale's hardline views, openly calling for a separate state for Sikhs as the only "permanent solution" to Punjab's problems. He has been able to tap into Sikh anxieties by drawing parallels between their sovereignty and Hindu nationalist identity. Singh's popularity surge can also be attributed to the frustrations of many young people in Punjab who are not well-to-do, not that educated, can't find any work, and don't have the resources to go abroad.`,

The letter pad had no names of WPD office-bearers but contained a stamp and pictures of Deep Sidhu and Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale.<br/>The letter pad announced that WPD units would be created soon after discussions. Deep Sidhu's family called it fake, but Amritpal Singh, who prioritised Khalistan for WPD, already had social media followers and actor Daljit Singh Kalsi's support. Basant Singh Moga collected phone numbers of youth attracted to WPD, even before Amritpal arrived in Punjab, and Kalsi toured the world to gather support. Gurmeet Singh Bukanwala was also a founder member of WPD.<br/>Jaggi Baba was the face of WPD before Amritpal Singh gained attention. WPD's structure was not expanded despite the response from Punjab youth. Amritpal Singh planned to launch AKF during Hola Mohalla, but he did not go after the Ajnala clash. Lovepreet Singh was appointed president of Gurudaspur. Kulwant Singh Rauke was among the founder members who was booked under NSA.<br/>Amritpal Singh's security team, which called themselves the Anandpur Khalsa Fauj (AKF), had AKF written on their weapons and the front door of Singh's house. The AKF members had licensed weapons and joined Singh's security team, and were not linked to Deep Sidhu or the WPD. Additionally, Singh announced plans to open a school for foreign-born children of NRIs to connect to Punjab. These decisions were made solely by Singh, and the WPD members followed his orders.`,

The Khalistan movement sought to create a separate homeland for Sikhs. They want to establish a sovereign state called Khālistān in the Punjab region. The call for a separate Sikh state began after the fall of the British Empire, with the first explicit call for Khalistan made in a pamphlet in 1940. Let’s dive into the history of the Khalistan movement, from its origins to the present day. We'll take a closer look at how the movement has evolved over time.`,

Two major civil-liberties organisations issued a joint report on the anti-Sikh riots, naming 16 significant politicians, 13 police officers, and 198 others accused by survivors and eyewitnesses.

Following Deep Sidhu's death in February 2022, Amritpal Singh was raised as the new leader of Waris Punjab De. He moved back to India in September 2022 and has since been actively following the ideology and tactics of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale.<br/>Amritpal Singh is using social media and the internet to propagate his ideas much faster than Bhindranwale did in the late 1980s. Amritpal Singh has been connecting with Sikh youth through social media platforms such as Facebook, Clubhouse, Twitter spaces, and Instagram. Peepoye came across four Clubhouse replays that shed light on Deep Sidhu and Amritpal Singh's discussions with their followers under the Waris Punjab De banner. One discussion occurred on November 19, 2021, with Deep Sidhu as the speaker and Amritpal Singh as the moderator. The other three replays were of the discussions that took place after Deep Sidhu's death.`,

After the Agriculture Laws were repealed, Sidhu stated that his group did not prioritize crops and farmer issues but rather community issues, particularly given that Sikhs were leading the farmer protests. Sidhu felt that a plan primarily focused on community issues was essential, referencing demands made by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and others. However, the demand for Khalistan became taboo after the January 26 incident at the Red Fort, leading to the isolation of Sidhu and his associates. During the discussions, both Sidhu and Amritpal expressed disappointment that the leadership of the protests failed to fully capitalize on opportunities to achieve their goals, with Sidhu feeling that his group was unfairly sidelined and subjected to propaganda. He also criticized the Left for its ideological differences with the Sikh community and expressed disregard towards Bhagat Singh, whom he felt could not achieve the aims of Sikhism.`,

He observed that farmers entering politics will not gain momentum as they tend to follow the directives of their national leaders.<br/>Meanwhile, Deep Sidhu and Amritpal Singh discussed plans to expand Waris Punjab De by creating an ecosystem or local cells exclusive to the state. They intend to enlist experts in various fields, such as legal, entertainment, and education, to increase their presence in every section of society. Amritpal urged people to form small groups in their cities, towns, and villages and send a list of interested individuals to their team for recognition. These smaller groups will eventually be responsible for managing events independently, without intervention from the main leadership.<br/>Regarding the ideological division between those seeking Khalistan, Amritpal acknowledged the difficulty in changing the mindset of established groups but emphasized the need to focus on developing their structure and inviting youth to join. He also talked about creating Hindu cells of Waris Punjab De and bringing Punjabi Hindus who support the demand for Khalistan under its umbrella.`,

He also talked about the conspiracy of settling migrants in Punjab to change the state's demography and suggested settling them without giving them aadhaar, ration card, and voter card.<br/>He urged Sikh women to get involved in the movement and demand reservation in education and jobs. He also expressed support for those demanding Khalistan, including deemed terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannu's Sikhs For Justice, cautioning followers to support them with care.`,

System ko priority de Es system me sub kuch dene ke baad mujhe kya mila insult, dipression, family distractions, health issues.

However, not all teachers are mature enough to handle situations. Sometimes, they want attention when they see others getting it. Even with their flaws, they deserve respect for their love of teaching.<br/>When some of the Physical Wallah teachers decided to leave, they explained why they were leaving. This is important because students might wonder why their teachers left. However, the Chemistry teacher, Pankaj Sir, blamed them for taking money from Adda 247 and planning to defame Physics Wallah. He accused them of defamation. Giving reasons for leaving is not defamation, but accusing someone of plotting against you is. Physics Wallah and Adda 247 are both businesses with more than 10 million downloads on Playstore and share some investors. So, it's not right to accuse anyone of conspiring against you. In fact, it's completely fine if adda247 offers them more money to join their institute since seeking growth is not a crime. Sometime before, Physics Wallah has also been accused of poaching by Apni Kaksha, but we still support Physics Wallah because it's common for companies to seek good resources.<br/>You might have a very noble mission, but the investors do not invest in your idea because of your mission, they are just interested in growing their money. That does not mean that you should not get investment because even if your ideas are great, you still need money to execute them and impact a larger segment. But it is realistic to note that you might need to compromise somewhere because you are now required to also listen to the investors. Playing with the emotions of students is not good and doesn't suit you as a teacher. Students should be allowed to choose whom they want to study with, and what content and teaching methods they prefer. No one should be forced emotionally.<br/>What do you think?`,

It can cause students to feel powerless and humiliated, leading to feelings of shame, low self-esteem, and even suicidal thoughts. Students who experience physical violence in their formative years may be more likely to engage in aggressive behavior later in life or have difficulty forming healthy relationships.<br/>It is important to understand that corporal punishment is not an effective way to discipline students. In fact, research has shown that positive reinforcement and non-violent disciplinary strategies are more effective in promoting good behaviour and improving academic performance.`,

Unfortunately, the involvement of students in the blame game and using them as a tool to generate emotions is not fair. It can create a negative impact on the students as they are the ones who ultimately suffer.<br/>In this situation, it's crucial for teachers and ed-tech companies to resolve their issues without affecting the students' studies. It's time for everyone involved to put aside their personal interests and work towards the betterment of the students' education. After all, the students are the future of our nation, and it's important to ensure that their education is not compromised in any way. It's the responsibility of all parties involved to prioritize the students' well-being and education above everything else.`,

The act has sparked a heated debate online, with some criticizing her clothing choice and others applauding her for expressing herself. But is this a case of personal expression or just a desperate cry for attention? Lets discuss in this blog.`,

The video was reportedly taken by a fellow passenger, who then shared it on social media. The act has since garnered mixed reactions from the public.<br/>Many have speculated that Chanana was inspired by Mumbai's latest fashion sensation, Uorfi Javed. However, Chanana denied being influenced by Javed's style. she told "I didn't even know who she was until recently a friend showed me her photo. However, I look up to her after knowing her story".<br/>Chanana defended her clothing choice, saying that she's been traveling like this for months and that she doesn't care what people think of her. "It's my freedom what I want to wear. I am not doing this for a publicity stunt or to become famous," she said.<br/>The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) issued a statement urging commuters to follow "social etiquette and protocols which are acceptable in society." The statement also emphasized that passengers should not wear any attire that could offend the sensibilities of other commuters. The DMRC's Operations and Maintenance Act lists indecency as a punishable offense under section 59.`,

You open your closet and start picking out your clothes, but suddenly, you hear a little voice in your head: "Where are you going? What's the temperature like? Is this appropriate for the occasion?"<br/>Yes, that voice is your common sense, reminding you that there is a limit to what you should wear in different places and situations. It's not just about following the latest fashion trends or copying what you see on social media. It's about using your brain and sense to make good decisions about what you wear.<br/>If you're going to the beach or swimming pool, wearing a bikini is perfectly acceptable. But if you're taking a bus or a train, wearing a bikini might not be the best idea. It's not only uncomfortable for you but could also make other passengers uncomfortable.<br/>Similarly, if you're going to a formal event, like a wedding or a job interview, you should dress appropriately. Wearing a casual outfit or ripped jeans might not be the best choice. On the other hand, if you're going to a casual party or hanging out with friends, you can dress more freely and comfortably.<br/>Looking back at history, people have always been mindful of what they wear. Even in the Bronze Age, people used animal skins to protect themselves from the cold. They knew that wandering around naked wasn't the best idea, and they used their common sense to stay warm and safe.`,

It's about being intelligent and senseful.<br/>In fact, there are laws against obscene behaviour in public places. If someone is doing something obscene and it annoys other people, they can be punished for up to three years. So, it's essential to use your common sense and know where and what to wear.<br/>Remember, wearing fashionable clothes might seem good on the runway, but it's not always appropriate for everyday life. It's not about being right or wrong; it's about having common sense.<br/>What do you think?`,

Sandhu used to make threatening calls to the probable targets whom Jasneet used to blackmail for money. A case has been filed against the accused under sections 384 (extortion), 506 (criminal intimidation), and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). According to the police investigation, Jasneet Kaur was arrested in a similar case in 2008 in Mohali. During her initial interrogation, she said that she lived a luxurious life.`,

Whenever it is played or sung, people from all walks of life come together, stand at attention, salute, and chant with pride. The anthem was composed by Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore and highlights India's rich heritage and traditions, as well as the importance of patriotism and loyalty toward our country. It reflects the history, traditions and composite culture of India and has been serving as an expression of national identity since its adoption.<br/>Showing disrespect towards India's national anthem and flag is not acceptable as it is a matter of emotional connection to the entire nation. National symbols represent the pride and identity of the country, and any insult towards them is unacceptable. We should remember that these symbols are not just pieces of cloth or words, but they represent the unity, diversity and heritage of the country, which is why we must uphold their dignity and honour. Any act of dishonour towards them is a direct attack on the nation and its people. Therefore, it is essential to show respect towards national symbols and treat them with the utmost honour and reverence.`,

Let us all work together towards building a society that celebrates diversity and promotes acceptance of different cultures and languages.`,

    summary: `Recently, a controversial video involving the Dalai Lama went viral, causing many in the Ladakh region to come out in support of their spiritual leader. The video allegedly showed the Dalai Lama in poor light, leading to widespread criticism and outrage. However, it's important to note that the video was misinterpreted, causing a great deal of distress among the Tibetan community.`,

        p: `The viral video, which has been circulating on social media, shows the Dalai Lama interacting with a young Indian boy during an event in February. In the video, the boy asks for a hug from the spiritual leader, who then blesses him and asks him to kiss him on the cheek. The Dalai Lama then playfully sticks out his tongue and asks the boy to "suck my tongue."<br/>Unfortunately, this innocent moment has been taken out of context and twisted into something much more sinister. People across the world are blaming the Nobel Peace Prize-winning leader for behaving inappropriately. These accusations are not only baseless but also deeply offensive to the Tibetan community, who hold the Dalai Lama in high regard.<br/>Many people in the Ladakh region have come out in support of the Dalai Lama, with local organisations and residents taking to the streets to show their solidarity. Sonam Wangchuk, a prominent intellectual and innovator based in Ladakh, has also spoken out in defence of the spiritual leader.`,

    summary: `India is a land of diverse cultures and religions, where temples hold great significance for millions of people. However, in recent years, a new trend has emerged - VIP Darshan. This practice allows people with connections or wealth to bypass long lines and receive special treatment at temples. Recently, a video went viral on social media where an elderly woman was unable to get a glimpse of Lord Mahakal despite waiting in line for a long time. The reason for her disappointment? VIPs in front of her causing chaos and delaying her turn. The woman's frustration reached a boiling point, and she decided to take matters into her own hands by jumping over the barricade and entering the VIP Darshan System without listening to any of the security personnel. In a fit of anger, she shouted, "धर्म को धंधा बना दिया है” (religion has become a business).`,
    sections: [
      {
        h1: `Why VIP darshan is wrong?`,
        h2: false,
        p: `Temples are considered to be holy places where people go to worship and connect with God. It is believed that for God, everyone is equal and there is no discrimination based on wealth or status. VIP Darshan culture goes against this principle of equality and humility.<br/>In this system, people who pay more money get to skip the long lines and get a faster darshan of the deity. Temples need donations to keep running, but people should give them voluntarily. There should not be a system where people pay money to get a faster darshan in a separate line. This is not really a donation, it's more like a business transaction. If there are two separate lines, one paid and one free, it's not fair to call it a donation. By giving priority to VIPs, temples are creating a hierarchy among devotees which can lead to feelings of resentment and discrimination.<br/>Moreover, VIP Darshan can cause chaos and safety hazards in the temple premises as it takes up a lot of space. The purpose of a temple is to provide a peaceful and spiritual environment for all devotees to worship and connect with God. The introduction of VIP Darshan goes against this principle and can lead to a loss of the sanctity of the temple.`,

Donations should be given willingly, without any expectation of special treatment in return. If someone can't wait in long lines, they can always pray to God from their home.<br/>We can learn from the story of Bhagwan Ram in the Ramayana, who made a shivling and started worshipping it. On the other hand Ravana tried to take Shiv Bhagwan to his place to show his power, which led to disastrous consequences. This shows that the true essence of spirituality lies in our devotion and connection with God, not in the display of wealth or status.`,

        p: `This is not the first time that a Korean vlogger has encountered such incidents in India. In November 2022, six months prior to Jenn Bae's incident, a Twitch streamer from Korea named mhyochi, was traveling and live streaming it on the platform with around 1000 viewers when she experienced a traumatic incident. Two boys, Mobeen Chand and Mohammad Naqeeb, forcibly kissed her without her consent, causing her to feel violated and vulnerable. The incident was caught on camera and quickly went viral, sparking outrage and concern among viewers and the online community.<br/>However, A man who was watching Hyojeong's live stream saw what was happening and immediately rushed to her rescue. He bravely stepped in and distanced the two accused men, preventing any further harm to the Korean streamer. Hyojeong was incredibly grateful for the man's intervention and took to social media to express her appreciation.<br/>She posted a picture on Twitter of herself having lunch with the man named Atharva. In the caption, she thanked him for helping her. Despite the traumatic incident, Hyojeong maintained a positive attitude and even said that she still loves India, the country where the incident took place.<br/>She clarified that the incident could happen anywhere in the world and didn't want people to think that it happened only because it's India. Hyojeong has traveled extensively and met many wonderful people throughout her journeys. She didn't want one bad experience to ruin her travels or her passion for showcasing the beauty of India to others.<br/>Furthermore, Hyojeong shared that something similar happened to her in another country, but she wasn't able to call the police there. In India, however, she felt that action was taken quickly and efficiently to address the situation. Many people were offering her their help and support, and she was confident that such an incident wouldn't happen again.<br/>Some people tried to justify the boys' behavior by claiming that Hyojeong is overly friendly, but it's important to remember that being friendly does not mean giving consent. These incidents bring to light the issue of harassment and assault faced by women. It's crucial to understand that such incidents are unacceptable under any circumstances. Everyone has the right to travel and explore without fear of harassment or assault, regardless of their nationality or background.`,

        p: `Last October, some of India's most prominent wrestlers sat in protest at Jantar Mantar after leveling serious allegations against the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief. The allegations were of sexual harassment against female wrestlers for several years, and the wrestlers refused to back down until an oversight committee was put in place to investigate their claims.<br/>This protest, however, did not put an end to the issue. On April 23rd of this year, the protest was resumed at New Delhi's Jantar Mantar, with wrestlers such as Olympic medallists Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik, along with world championship medallist Vinesh Phogat, leading the charge. The reason for their protest was the continued accusations of sexual harassment against WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.<br/>In their complaints filed with the Connaught Place Police Station in New Delhi, seven women wrestlers accused Singh of sexual harassment and criminal intimidation. Despite the complaints filed by the wrestlers, the Delhi Police has not yet filed an FIR.<br/>In addition to the allegations of sexual harassment, the wrestlers are also demanding that the report submitted to the sports ministry by the government-appointed probe committee be made public. They have approached the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) seeking police action and expressed unhappiness that the findings of the Oversight Committee have not yet been made public.<br/>In a video message on Sunday, Vinesh, along with Sakshi and Bajrang, said that the Delhi Police had not taken any action even after they filed complaints. They said that they are fighting for justice for their sisters and daughters and will win if they fight together.`,

However, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh is a controversial figure with a wide fanbase. He has been accused of harassing wrestlers, but his strong influence in the Gonda-Balrampur-Bahraich belt of Uttar Pradesh may protect him from political consequences.<br/>According to sources, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh was a motorcycle thief and even part of a liquor mafia in the 1980s. He was also involved in the Babri Masjid Demolition Case in 1992 and was charged with TADA for helping Dawood Ibrahim in organizing the J.J Hospital Shootout. In 2022, he confessed to murdering the person who shot his close friend Ravinder Singh. In addition, during a junior wrestling tournament in 2021, he was caught on camera slapping a wrestler on stage.<br/>His sons, Prateek Bhushan Singh and Karan Bhushan Singh are also in the public eye, with Prateek being a BJP MLA from Gonda and Karan being the vice-president of the WFI.`,

        p: `The Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) is responsible for organizing wrestling tournaments and selecting the wrestlers who will represent India in national and international competitions. In recent years, the WFI has introduced new rules to ensure transparency and fairness in the selection process. One of these rules is that all wrestlers must compete in the trials, regardless of their past performance or reputation. This means that even if a wrestler has won a medal in a previous competition, they still have to prove their worth in the trials if they want to be selected for the national team.<br/>Another rule introduced by the WFI is that no state can send more than one team to the national championships. This is seen as a way to level the playing field for wrestlers from smaller states, who may not have as many resources as the larger states like Haryana, which has a strong tradition of wrestling. In the past, the Haryana team has dominated the national championships, winning multiple medals in each weight category.<br/>The WFI has also changed the way Olympic quotas are awarded to wrestlers. In the past, the wrestler who won the most tournaments in a given weight category was automatically given the Olympic quota. Under the new rules, all wrestlers who want to be considered for the Olympic team must undergo a separate set of trials to determine their fitness and readiness.<br/>During the Tokyo Olympics 2020, Vinesh Phogat was suspended for a short time by the Wrestling Federation of India. She was accused of being undisciplined and not following the rules. The federation stated that Vinesh did not wear the clothes of the official sponsor of the Indian team and also refused to stay with the Indian contingent. These actions were considered a violation of the code of conduct for athletes representing the country. As a result, she was temporarily suspended by the federation.<br/>Brij Bhushan, the president of the Wrestling Federation of India, said that the accusations made against him and the federation were planned. He also claimed that no player had played any national-level match after the Olympics. According to him, the players want special favors in the trials. They do not want to participate in any trial, and they want rules to be bent in their favor.`,

The committee was given four weeks to complete the probe and run the WFI's functioning during the period.<br/>However, on January 31, the protesting wrestlers complained that they were not consulted on the names of the panel members. As a result, Babita Phogat was included in the Oversight Committee as the sixth member. On April 23, wrestlers, including Bajrang Punia, Vinesh Phogat, and Sakshi Malik, returned to the protest site at Jantar Mantar, demanding that the Delhi Police register an FIR against Singh based on the complaint and asking the Ministry to make public the findings of the Oversight Committee.<br/>On Thursday, the Supreme Court of India closed the proceedings by wrestlers. The court said that the purpose of the petition had been served, as the FIR had been registered, and security had been provided to the wrestlers. The court asked the wrestlers to approach the High Court or trial court for further relief.`,

He expressed his disappointment with the way the wrestlers were being treated, saying, "This is how they respect daughters."<br/>Rio Olympics bronze medalists Sakshi Malik and Vinesh Phogat were also seen arguing with officials in a video that surfaced from the location. Vinesh Phogat stated that due to the way they have been treated, she would not want any athlete to win a medal for the country.<br/>A senior police officer said that Section 144 had been imposed, and anyone outside the line of barricades was removed. It is important to show respect for the athletes who have won medals for our country, and to ensure that their rights are protected. The ongoing protest and allegations serve as a reminder of the importance of listening to and addressing the concerns of athletes and ensuring that they are treated fairly and with dignity.`,

Once the investigation's results come out, the decision regarding the new president should be made based on their credentials. Transparency is key to building trust and ensuring accountability. It is crucial that the oversight report of the investigation should be made public so that we can better understand the findings.<br/>At the same time, We must also recognize that there should not be a monopoly or nepotism in any industry, including wrestling.

        p: `Moto vlogging has surged in popularity on YouTube, giving motorcycle enthusiasts a platform to share their love for adventure and connect with others. However, the trend has also raised concerns about dangerous and reckless behavior by some vloggers.<br/>Many riders, such as UK07 Rider, Prabhjot, Pro Rider 1000, Aamir Majid and ZS Motovlogs, engage in overspeeding and risky stunts in a bid to boost views and earnings, often putting their own and others' lives at risk. In addition, many of these moto vloggers also compete with each other to hit a specific target speed. They aim to hit a specific target speed and often mock those who fail to achieve it, encouraging even more dangerous behavior. For example, in a live stream, Aamir Majid exceeded 300kmph, while UK07 Rider's highest speed was 299kmph, and Majid ridiculed him for it. Such competitions only encourage more dangerous behavior and can have fatal consequences. Despite this, many viewers enjoy this type of content and often encourage these vloggers to engage in even more risky behavior.<br/>Unfortunately, this normalization of breaking traffic rules and promoting a dangerous culture can have fatal consequences, particularly given the increasing number of road accidents and fatalities. For instance, the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) reported that in 2021, out of the 155,622 road accident deaths in India, nearly 70,000 were two-wheeler riders. Therefore, is it worth risking lives for the sake of online fame?`,

He expressed feeling afraid and uneasy due to his helmet but persisted in his attempt to reach his goal. The police have yet to determine the exact cause of the accident, but have confirmed that Agastya was overspeeding at the time.

This will enable authorities to ensure that penalties are appropriately enforced. Additionally, citizens should be encouraged to report any instances of corruption, such as when a police officer's nameplate is not visible, and recording should be permitted.<br/>Another potential solution is to improve road infrastructure to make roads safer for all users. This could involve enhancing lighting, signage, and pedestrian crossings to reduce the number of accidents on the road.<br/>Moto vlogging can be conducted responsibly, as exemplified by Mumbiker Nikhil, who has never been seen breaking traffic rules yet has produced engaging and popular videos. Other moto vloggers should follow his lead. We commend UK07 rider for acknowledging their mistake after we raised our concerns about reckless moto vlogging.<br/>Moto Vlogger Jatt Prabhjot also expressed regret by commenting on our video that he now understands the importance of responsible moto vlogging. Other YouTubers from the moto vlogging community, such as Ashwin Singh Takiar and Pranab Rai, also stepped forward to promote awareness about responsible riding by commenting on our video.<br/>Change begins with individual responsibility, and it is time for other moto vloggers to take accountability for their actions and set a positive example for their viewers. We urge other moto vloggers to come forward and publicly acknowledge the importance of responsible riding to spread awareness about the risks associated with dangerous stunts and encourage their viewers to ride safely.`,

You see, the film delves into the issue of forceful religious conversions and the manipulation of people to join ISIS, all happening right in Kerala. And guess what? Similar cases of "love jihad" are popping up all over the country.<br/>So, while the number might be up for debate, the movie's message about the forces at play in religious conversions and their connection to extremist groups remains the core issue. It's like a puzzle with different pieces that need to be carefully put together. While watching this movie, we need to keep our minds open and explore the complexities of this controversial subject.<br/>The director of the film, Sudipto Sen, was asked about the number 32,000 mentioned in the movie. In response, he said, "Do you think the number actually matters? The 32,000 number is arbitrary but based on facts." Sudipto Sen also mentioned that they had tried to obtain the numbers from the government but did not receive any response or assistance regarding this matter.`,

However, the director of the film says they have been working on it for the past seven years. It’s interesting that if it is a propaganda movie for this election, how could they start working on it seven years ago?<br/>Despite the claims, there isn't any solid evidence to support the idea that the film is propaganda. While political parties may try to use this issue for their own benefit, accusing it directly as propaganda without understanding the main problem seems to show that Dhruv has a strong dislike for the political party.`,

However, it is important to note that the film's central theme does not solely revolve around Kerala itself. Instead, it delves into the broader issue of forced conversion and the manipulation of individuals into becoming terrorists.<br/>The film sheds light on the distressing practice of forceful conversions and how innocent individuals are manipulated and brainwashed to join terrorist organizations. While some viewers may interpret the depiction of certain incidents happening within Kerala as an attempt to defame the state, it is crucial to understand that these incidents are not exclusive to Kerala alone. The film aims to highlight the alarming reality of such occurrences happening throughout India.<br/>The movie aims to make people aware of this issue and start conversations about it. While some people claim that the film defames Kerala, it's essential to understand that the movie's main goal is to address a bigger problem. It encourages us to have productive discussions about the root causes of this problem and find ways to tackle it.`,

        p: `It's important to approach social issues without always seeing them through a political lens or a specific ideology. This movie tackles a mix of social issues that are not unique to India but are prevalent worldwide. Such films should be appreciated for their efforts to shed light on important matters. That's why this movie deserves the success it has achieved, including its positive box office results.<br/>Many people who criticise the film as propaganda might have formed their opinions based solely on Dhruv Ratee's video. However, it is crucial to watch the movie itself to truly understand the core issue it addresses. One heartbreaking moment in the film is when a girl returns to her parents and asks why they didn't teach her about her religion. It prompts us to reflect on the blame we often place on our parents and encourages us to take ownership of our own understanding.<br/>Each person can find answers to their questions within their religious book or teachings. It's important to recognise the significance of the place and religion in which we are born, understanding and embracing it as part of our identity. By comprehending our beliefs properly, we become less susceptible to being manipulated or brainwashed by others.<br/>So, let us not rush to judgment or form opinions based solely on external influences. Instead, watch the movie, explore its core themes, and open ourselves up to the possibilities of personal growth and introspection. By doing this, we can explore complex social issues and gain a better understanding of ourselves and the world we live in.`,

Just to glorify it, they compare the salary, but they forget that they are talking about sales, not the net income from that business.`,

This aspect plays a significant role in the popularity of these trends.<br/>Another reason for their popularity is their distinctive style. For instance, there is a chaiwala named Dolly who tries to portray the iconic Rajinikanth style while making or serving tea. This unique style of presentation further captures people's attention. Through effective marketing, these chaiwallahs are gaining fame for their stall names, which creates brand recall. If these names are trademarked, it becomes easier to enter the franchise model and establish a consistent source of income.`,

        p: `While the Chaiwala business model may appear enticing with its potential for revenue, easy money, and opportunity, it is crucial not to overlook the associated risks. Often, the allure of success can overshadow the potential pitfalls that lie ahead. To ensure a sustainable venture, entrepreneurs must be aware of the risks and take necessary precautions.<br/>A poorly chosen spot can result in low footfall and limited visibility, hampering the business's potential. For example, if you are planning to open a full-fledged restaurant or cafe, opting for a tier 3 location may not be ideal since people visit cafes for the experience, not just for coffee or tea.<br/>Inconsistency in quality, unprofessional behaviour, or negative customer experiences can also affect the brand's reputation, causing irreparable damage. Diligent efforts to uphold high standards of cleanliness, exceptional customer service, and unwavering product quality are vital to protect and enhance the brand's image.<br/>Wide variations in taste between different outlets or even within the same outlet can disappoint customers and deter them from returning. Standardising recipes, using high-quality ingredients, and conducting regular taste tests are essential measures to minimise this risk and ensure a consistently excellent product.<br/>By acknowledging and actively addressing these risks, chaiwala businesses can enhance their chances of success and establish a strong position in the competitive market. Taking proactive measures to mitigate these risks will not only protect the business but also ensure customer satisfaction, loyalty, and continued growth.`,

Without knowledge and planning, the business can face destruction. A good example is the Chai Sutta Bar model, which focused on their product and services instead of just creating hype around their CEO. They built a well-structured business around it.<br/>It's crucial not to believe everything that is being sold to us. We need to take ownership of our decisions and be cautious. Blindly following trends or relying solely on hype can lead to disappointment and failure. It's essential to gather information, do research, and make informed choices based on solid business principles.<br/>The success of a chaiwala business depends on more than just catchy names or gimmicks. It relies on the quality of the products, consistent taste, excellent customer service, and careful planning. By focusing on these core elements and establishing a strong foundation, the business can grow and thrive in the long run.<br/>As entrepreneurs, it's important to adapt to changing trends and meet the evolving demands of customers. Engaging with customers, seeking their feedback, and continuously improving the offerings are key to staying relevant in the market.<br/>What do you think?`,

        p: `An interlocking system plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety and smooth operation of trains at railway junctions, stations, and signalling points. One of the key functions of the interlocking system is to ensure that the points, which are movable sections of the track allowing trains to switch tracks, are correctly aligned and locked before a train can pass over them. Additionally, track circuits, which are electrical circuits installed on the track, help detect the presence of trains. They provide information about whether a particular section of track is occupied or vacant, enabling the interlocking system to regulate train movements accordingly.<br/>Electronic interlocking is an advanced system that uses software and electronic parts to control and monitor train movements. According to the rail minister, a modification in the electronic interlocking system might have caused wrong signals or incorrect directions. As a result, the Coromandel Express, travelling at high speed of over 120kmph, ended up on a side track instead of the main line. Tragically, it collided with a stationary goods train parked there.`,

        p: `Dutch vlogger, Pedro was exploring the Chickpet market while making a vlog. In this vlog, he was interacting with many people, enjoying the travels, and experiencing the warm hospitality of India's "atithi devo bhavah" culture. Suddenly, a man named Navab Hayah Sharif approached Pedro with a visibly angry expression on his face. He started interrogating Pedro, asking him why he was carrying a camera and what he intended to do with it. Pedro, trying to keep the situation calm, explained that he was simply recording his experiences and sharing them with his audience.<br/>However, Navab's anger escalated, and he grabbed Pedro's hand forcefully, not giving him a chance to explain further. Pedro, feeling trapped and threatened, managed to free himself from Navab's grip and swiftly moved away from the scene.<br/>Despite this disturbing encounter, Pedro remained resilient and continued his vlogging journey, determined not to let one negative experience overshadow his overall positive impressions of India. He understood that unfortunate incidents can happen anywhere, but he chose to focus on the kindness and warmth he had encountered from most people he had met throughout his travels.`,

First and foremost, when Pedro greeted Navab Hayath Sharif with a traditional and respectful "Namaskaar," he received an unexpectedly hostile response. This raises a thought-provoking question: Is it now considered risky or inappropriate to extend such greetings to Indian Muslims? It's important to remember that respect and acceptance are values that lie at the core of every religion. Welcoming greetings, whether it's "Namaskaar" or "Salaam Walaekum", should be embraced as gestures of goodwill. In our diverse nation, it is this acceptance of different cultures and religions that strengthens our unity and makes us feel like one big family.`,

    summary: `Adipurush has been caught up in a whirlwind of controversies even before its release. Ever since it hit theaters, it has faced heavy criticism, leading to a growing call for boycotting the movie. The reason behind this uproar lies in certain scenes and dialogues that have struck a nerve with the audience. At first, the writer, Manoj Muntashir, and Director Om Raut claimed that they stayed true to the essence of Ramayana without making any changes. However, their statements took a sudden turn, now describing the movie as an "adaptation" and "inspiration." In this blog, we will address the mistakes and misconceptions made by the Adipurush makers and provide a rebuttal to their claims.`,

Since childhood, we have grown up listening to this timeless tale, often watching the iconic Ramayana series by Ramanand Sagar. When Adipurush was announced, there was a collective hope among the audience to relive those moments, but with the added advancements in technology. <br/>However, instead of investing in capturing the true essence of Ramayana, Adipurush took a different path. It attempted to commercialize the story and created propaganda that overlooked the opportunity to showcase the greatness of this ancient Hindu scripture. Instead of staying true to the core values, Adipurush opted to include disrespectful scenes solely to cater to the mass market and prioritize commercial interests.`,

This mistake changes the significance of Jaamvant's contribution in the story.<br/>Meghnad is shown as a south delhi tattoo artist, Ravana as a rockstar who plays the veena, receives messages from pythons, wears a welding shield while making his sword, and dresses in leather clothes. These strange additions not only distort the characters but also show a lack of respect for the original text and the writers who created it.<br/>This movie tries to draw a parallel between Ravana and the Mughal dynasty without any logical basis.

Yet, following the widespread backlash on the internet, he altered his statement, claiming that Adipurush is merely inspired by Ramayana. This turn of events raises questions about the sincerity and credibility of their intentions.<br/>In an attempt to mitigate the backlash and neutralize audience sentiments, the film's team tried a public relations stunt by featuring a "Jai Shree Ram" chant in a theater, as seen on Kriti Sanon's Instagram. However, they failed to recognize that it is now 2023, and attempting to manipulate sentiments through such superficial PR tactics is unlikely to succeed.`,

Instead of honoring the epic tale that holds deep cultural and religious significance, they have chosen to prioritize monetary gains and mass-market appeal.<br/>Their disregard for the accuracy and integrity of the original story is evident in the numerous mistakes, fallacies, and distortions present in the movie. By altering key aspects of the narrative, misrepresenting characters, and introducing absurd elements, the filmmakers have not only disrespected the epic Ramayana and Ramcharitmanas, but they have also disappointed millions of Indians who hold this epic in high regard. They should apologize to all Indians because what they have done in the name of creativity is pathetic.<br/>What do you think?`,

    summary: `Manipur, a state in northeast India, is known for its beautiful hills and valleys. It is home to different communities, like the Meiteis in the central area and hill tribes like Kukis and Nagas in the surrounding regions. However, the state has faced political and ethnic tensions for a long time, which recently turned violent.`,

The remaining 40 seats are unreserved general constituencies, of which 39 were won by Meitei candidates in the last election. This lopsided representation has led to complaints from tribal groups, who feel that government spending and development are disproportionately concentrated in the Meitei-dominated Imphal Valley. The Meiteis make up 53% of the state's population.<br/>Adding to the complexities, the Land Reform Act of Manipur restricts Meiteis from settling in the hilly regions without the permission of the local district councils. This measure aims to protect the interests of the tribal communities and preserve their traditional way of life.`,

Officials claimed that illegal immigrants from Myanmar had been settling in Manipur since the 1970s, leading to concerns about the impact on local communities and the environment. However, these efforts triggered tensions with the Kuki tribe and other tribal communities who also have villages in these reserve forest areas.<br/>In February 2023, the BJP-led state government launched an eviction drive that was perceived as anti-tribal by the Kukis. The Kukis feared that the eviction drive might not only affect them directly but also have implications for other tribals living in reserve forest areas.`,

        p: `The situation took a more significant turn on April 20, 2023, when judge of the Manipur High Court directed the state government to "consider the request of the Meitei community to be included in the Scheduled Tribes (ST) list." The Kuki community was alarmed by this directive, as it feared that granting ST status to the Meiteis would allow them to purchase land in the prohibited hilly areas, leading to potential encroachment on tribal territories.

        In protest against the state government's actions, the tribal groups called for a total shutdown on April 28, 2023. The situation escalated as a mob set fire to the gym where Chief Minister N. Biren Singh was scheduled to inaugurate, resulting in vandalism and destruction of property. To control the escalating situation, Section 144 (of the Criminal Procedure Code) was imposed, and a five-day internet shutdown was enforced.<br/>The confrontation between protesters and the police led to clashes, with the authorities using tear gas shells to disperse the mobs. The violence further intensified on May 3, when the All Tribal Student Union Manipur (ATSUM) called for a "Tribal Solidarity March" in Churachandpur district, which turned violent.<br/>Amidst the unrest, the mostly Kuki tribal population in non-tribal areas faced attacks on their residences and churches. Even a Kuki MLA, Vunzjagin Valte of the BJP, who represented the tribal headquarters of Churachandpur, was attacked during the riots while returning from the state secretariat. To control the situation, the Manipur government issued a "shoot at sight" order on May 4, 2023.`,

One of the victims alleged that the police were involved, further heightening the gravity of the incident.<br/>The delayed response by the authorities in taking action and arresting the culprits was met with public outrage. It raised concerns about the state of law and order and the protection of vulnerable communities.<br/>On the other hand, the Indian media paid little attention to the situation in Manipur because they were more focused on getting high TRP. While Manipur was facing serious problems and many people were suffering, the media chose to show more exciting and dramatic news to attract more viewers.`,

While some basic provisions like food have been provided, essentials such as healthcare, sanitation, and sanitary pads are overlooked, leaving many vulnerable individuals without proper care and support.<br/>The education system has also been gravely affected, as many children are unable to attend school due to the ongoing unrest and destruction of educational facilities. The lack of access to quality education may have long-term implications for the future generation, hindering their chances of a better life.<br/>One of the most significant concerns stemming from the clashes is the delayed response by the authorities in taking appropriate action. The viral video that exposed the horrific mistreatment of Kuki women brought the issue to the forefront, and it happened on 4th May 2023, making it more than 2 and a half months old. However, the fact that it took months for arrests to be made raises questions about the effectiveness and efficiency of the state's law enforcement and judicial system.`,

True education, however, extends beyond the confines of a classroom. It involves acquiring expertise on specific topics and gaining hands-on experience in one's professional domain. Such education enriches the decision-making process with practical knowledge and problem-solving abilities.<br/>Politics demands a deep understanding of socioeconomic challenges, cultural dynamics, and historical contexts. Ironically, Kajol critiqued leaders without educational backgrounds when she herself is a school dropout. While education is undoubtedly valuable, it is not the sole indicator of a leader's competence.<br/>There are many examples of individuals who didn’t receive any formal education but still have real-life experiences that make them great in their respective fields.`,

The women were visibly intoxicated and, in their agitated state, verbally abused the police officer. As tensions rose, one of the ladies even snatched the officer's phone and threw it on the ground to prevent him from filming the scene. The situation accelerated quickly and attracted the crowd. Eventually, a female officer arrived at the scene, and the women were taken to the police station for a medical examination. It was later confirmed that they were indeed drunk, and their families were called to take them home.`,

The pet owner went inside the lift when people were already there, and at the same time, the couple could also have waited instead of engaging in an argument. If they could try to understand each other and talk calmly, putting aside ego and focusing on respectful communication, it could help create a better atmosphere where everyone's safety is valued and upheld.`,

A police contingent was deployed with the yatra. Around 2 pm, more than 200 people started walking from Edward Chowk in Nuh town. A large crowd then pelted stones at the procession. Initially, the Hindu side fled, but later they retaliated.<br/>As per the reports, there was a viral video in which Monu Manesar, a cow vigilante with a history of murders, created tension in the area. However, Monu Manesar said he did not participate on the advice of the VHP, which feared that his presence would create tension, the vigilante told PTI.`,

Spreading fake news and misinformation through propaganda has led to the propagation of hatred.<br/>On one side, the literacy rate is increasing day by day, but a critical thinking and questioning mentality are still missing. People can easily be swayed to believe anything. When we receive any news, we should always verify it with more than one reliable source.<br/>The lack of media responsibility in verifying news and providing non-provocative information also adds fuel to the fire. It's high time for individuals to bridge the gaps of religion and work together to prevent such incidents in the future.`,

Creating videos or reels on the temple premises, especially for personal or frivolous reasons, can be seen as disrespectful and may disturb the peaceful environment that pilgrims and devotees seek when visiting such sacred places.<br/>The committee's call for action against those making such videos sends a clear message that any behavior undermining the spiritual significance of the temple will not be tolerated. By enforcing guidelines against the use of mobile phones, photography, and videography inside the temple, the committee aims to ensure that visitors focus on prayer, meditation, and experiencing the divine presence without unnecessary distractions.<br/>Every place has its dress code, and respecting a modest dress code when visiting religious places is a sign of showing acknowledgment of the sacredness of the site.

After the video went viral, Karan was removed from Unacademy. Unacademy co-founder, Roman Saini, stated that Sangwan was removed for breaching rules. In a statement tweeted on Thursday night, Saini said, "The classroom is not a place to share personal opinions and views as they can wrongly influence students. In the current situation, we were forced to part ways with Karan Sangwan as he was in breach of the Code of Conduct."`,

The upcoming boxing match between Dillon Danis and Logan Paul has gone too far in the wrong way by involving Nina Agdal, Logan Paul's fiancée.

By digging into Nina Agdal's dating history, Danis seems to be attempting to undermine Logan Paul's focus and confidence before the fight.

For some of them, politics appears to be a backup plan. When their movies don't do well, they consider joining politics. However, as soon as their movies start doing better, they might leave politics behind. This can be disappointing for the people who voted for them and hoped they would work hard to bring progress to their area. A recent example is Sunny Deol, who, after a successful movie like Gadar 2, is now expressing his desire to step away from politics, suggesting that he feels politics might not be the best fit for him.`,

He continued to deliver hit movies like "Paap Ki Duniya" (1988), "Tridev" (1989), "ChaalBaaz" (1989), and "Ghayal" in the 1990s. "Ghayal" was a big success and marked a period of great achievement for Deol throughout the 90s. He kept giving one hit after another from 1991 to 2001.<br/>However, things changed after 2004 as Deol struggled to create successful movies. Most of his films faced failure except for a few like "Yamla Pagla Deewana" and "Apne." In the face of numerous setbacks, Deol decided to join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on 23 April 2019.<br/>He took part in the 2019 Lok Sabha Elections and emerged victorious from the Gurdaspur constituency in Punjab, defeating his rival Sunil Jakhar of the Indian National Congress by a margin of 82,459 votes. This marked the beginning of his political career.`,

But during his time in office, he only asked one question in the parliament and didn't talk much. In the 12 parliament sessions of about 246 days, he only went for 45 days, which is about 18.26% of the time. Most MPs ask around 156 questions on average, but he only asked one. He also didn't join any discussions in the parliament, while most MPs take part in about 42.7 debates. This shows that he didn't take part in the work as much as people might have expected.<br/>After facing challenges in his film career, "Gadar 2" marked a turning point for Sunny Deol as it became a huge success and an all-time blockbuster. Following this achievement, Sunny Deol developed a sense that he might be better suited for his career as an actor than as a politician. He made a decision not to participate in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Sunny Deol expressed, "When I joined politics, I thought certain things would happen, but now I realize I can do those things as an actor. People are showing me a lot of love. When things don't seem right, I think about exploring other paths." He also added that he is too good for politics and he won't be contesting any elections in 2024 and will maintain his identity as an actor.`,

When celebrities prioritize other pursuits without delivering on their political promises, it's the people who suffer the consequences. As voters, we should hold our elected representatives accountable for their actions and remind them that public office is not just a backup plan, but a commitment to serve the nation and its citizens.<br/>What do you think?`,

The West are trying to sell us the idea that we should fix poverty before even thinking about our space program. Seriously? Do they think progress works like a conveyor belt, where we can't move forward until every single person is rich and educated? That's like saying we should've waited until everyone had a golden toilet seat before developing COVID vaccines!<br/>Throughout history, and even today, when we look at the global economy, we see that only around 4% of people are considered wealthy. Another 6% are managing their finances well. However, a significant 90% of the population is struggling financially, with about 50% possibly living below the poverty line. If we refer to a report by Statisa, it becomes evident that the Global Wealth Pyramid is heavily skewed, with 1% of the world's population holding half of its wealth. The top 10% of adults possess 85% of the world's wealth, leaving only 15% for the remaining 90%. Another fact is that 55% of the world's population shares only 1.3% of the wealth.<br/>This data suggests that without substantial efforts, the rich are likely to continue getting richer while the poor struggle to escape poverty. The key lies in education, job creation, and innovative initiatives like successful space programs. With Lunar programs like Chandrayaan, we can achieve remarkable advancements for humanity and uncover endless possibilities.  If we come to the UK, where poverty rates are only 3% lower than in India. It raises questions about why developed nations don't seem to tackle this issue more effectively, especially considering their historical Loots from India. Still, if UK thinks that India is facing poverty then they should return us the loot they took from us which destroyed the golden bird and  they should also return us our precious diamond Kohinoor which again they looted from us in the name of gift.<br/>What do you think?

We should make sure that progress doesn't become more important than how we care for each other and show kindness.`,

    summary: `The Indian Railways, known for its vast network and diverse passenger experiences. Millions of passengers use to travel, though it is either for a long journey trip or local with their own journey, story, and expectations. Sometimes, these journeys lead to unexpected encounters, which reveal where systems lack and demand attention and improvement.`,

        p: `Imagine sitting down to enjoy a meal during your train journey, and you found something creepy in your food. This is exactly what happened to Subodh Pahalajan, a passenger traveling on the Vande Bharat Express from Bhopal to Gwalior. Subodh took to Twitter to share his shocking experience with the world. He tweeted a picture of his meal, which had an unwanted addition – a cockroach! He tagged the official Twitter handle of the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) and wrote, "@IRCTCofficial found a cockroach in my food, in the Vande Bharat train." His tweet quickly gained attention and when it went too viral, The Indian Railways responded to Subodh's complaint. Railway Seva, the official Twitter handle for railway-related grievances, issued an apology to Subodh for the unpleasant experience. They assured him and the public that the necessary actions would be taken to address the issue and prevent such incidents from occurring again in the future.<br/>The Divisional Railway Manager of Bhopal, not wanting to take the matter lightly, also joined the conversation on Twitter. He confirmed that immediate steps were taken to address the situation. The IRCTC promptly organized alternative food for the affected passenger and took punitive measures against the licensee.<br/>The Vande Bharat Express, considered as a premium travel service cockroach in its meal, has raised valid concerns about the quality of food provided on Indian trains. The question remains the same: who should bear the ultimate responsibility for such incidents? Is it solely the catering service provider who prepared and served the meal, or does the railway administration also share a part of the blame for granting licenses to these service providers? Can strict actions alone guarantee that such incidents won't be repeated in the future?<br/>As we continue to travel and rely on the railway system for our journeys, it's essential that these incidents serve as turning points for positive change. Ensuring the well-being and satisfaction of passengers should be a top priority, and incidents like these need improvements.`,

They allegedly recorded a video of their classmate while she was in the washroom. The accused claimed they intended to record some other girl but mistakenly recorded another. The video was subsequently deleted in front of the victim, and an apology was offered. However, the victim told her other friends about the incident, and the matter was reported to the management. The college management involved the police in the matter and handed over the phone to them. There were angry protests by other students over the violation of privacy and demanding strict action against the accused. The three students were suspended the very next day of the Incident.<br/>According to the college director Rashmi Krishna Prasad, the accused were suspended for two reasons- first, for bringing mobile phones to college, which is not allowed, and second, they used them to record a video in privacy and invade someone’s privacy.`,

The police, mentioned in their press release, have said that Abhimanyu was found acting suspiciously near the main door of the restroom, leading mall security guards to question him, who informed police about their suspicion.

        p: `In the world of Indian cricket, few rivalries have been as intense and long-lasting as those between Gautam Gambhir and Virat Kohli. The recent Asia Cup 2023 match between India and Nepal took an unexpected turn when Gautam Gambhir, a former cricketer and BJP Member of Parliament, was captured making an inappropriate gesture to the crowd. This incident has fueled a heated debate on social media and raised questions on sportsmanship and player-fan interactions.`,

        p: `Gautam Gambhir allegedly had poor relations with MS Dhoni and, ultimately with Virat Kohli.<br/>As believed by many, Dhoni had a hand behind the removal of Gambhir and Virender Sehwag from the squad. After being dropped, Gambhir and Sehwag never returned under Dhoni’s captaincy. Just two weeks before the release of Dhoni’s biopic, Gambhir tweeted that “he doesn’t believe in biopics on cricketers…”. He was slammed by the majority for his views. <br/>Just two weeks before the release of Dhoni’s biopic, Gambhir tweeted that “he doesn’t believe in biopics on cricketers…”. He was slammed by the majority for his views. Everybody has the right to disagree and share a different perspective respectfully, but people immediately forgot his contribution and started criticizing him.<br/>Gambhir said in an interview that the victory was made all about Kapil Dev, India's captain, in 1983, when they won their maiden World Cup trophy. Similarly, Dhoni is the focus of attention even now when India celebrates its 2007 T20 World Cup win and 2011 ODI World Cup victory.<br/>He said, “It’s unfortunate that when we talk about the 2007 and 2011 World Cups, we don’t take Yuvraj Singh’s name. Why not? It’s only and only marketing and PR and portraying one individual as the biggest and everyone else as smaller than him,” he had said. "We have been told who won us the 2007 and 2011 World Cups [but] it was not one individual it was the entire team. No one individual can win a big tournament. If that were the case, India would’ve had 5-10 World Cups."<br/>In light of this, Dhoni fans immediately pointed out the ‘hypocrisy’ when he made a statement during live commentary during India's Asia Cup match against Pakistan. According to him, the batter who scores the winning run symbolizes victory for a team as a whole.`,

He said, “What is shown on social media has no truth in it because people show whatever they want to show. The truth about the video that went viral is that if you raise anti-India slogans and speak about Kashmir, then the person before you will obviously react and not smile and leave. There were 2-3 Pakistanis there who were speaking anti-India things and things on Kashmir. So, it was my natural reaction. I can't hear anything against my country. So, that was my reaction..." <br/>He also tweeted on this issue: Gambhir also put out a tweet on the issue: “A lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes. Not everything is as it seems. Any Indian would react how I did to the kind of slogans used against our nation. I love our players; I love my country.”`,

Inshallah.” is a doctorate video. The slogans are from a protest at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) that happened in 2016, and you will see similarities in the slogans being called the actual video.

While Gambhir is a BJP MP, he receives support from his party's followers, but this matter transcends politics. On cricket field, respect for legends like Virat Kohli should always prevail. Kohli's contributions to Indian cricket are undeniable, and his legacy should be honored. We should always stand for what is right and respect the legends who have contributed to Indian cricket's glory. We should support what is right and condemn the wrong. In the end, it's the love for the game that truly matters.`,

    summary: `In the dimly lit corridors of Kolkata's Jadavpur University Main Hostel, a horrifying incident unfolded on the evening of August 9th. Ragging, once considered a harmless initiation ritual, has once again reared its ugly head in an educational institution. A 17-year-old student, Swapnodeep Kundu, pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Bengali Literature, tragically lost his life in a horrifying incident after being subjected to extreme humiliation and harassment by his seniors. This incident raises crucial questions about the prevalence of ragging, institutional negligence, mental health support, and the need for sensitization programs in educational institutions.<br/>As fearless and blunt opinion writers at Peepoye Network, we believe it is our moral responsibility to shed light on this incident and demand justice for Swapnodeep Kundu.`,

He was subjected to ragging and sexual harassment, which led to his unfortunate demise. He was called to Room No. 70 by his seniors and was forced to strip naked as he walked down the second-floor hallway of the university hostel. Desperate to escape this humiliating ordeal, Swapnodeep tried to lock himself in Room No. 65, but the senior students wouldn't stop pursuing him. The situation escalated as he ran from room to room on the second floor, and eventually, he fell from a second-floor balcony around 11:45 PM. As students arrived at the scene after hearing a loud noise, they discovered Swapnodeep lying in a pool of blood. Swapnodeep was transferred to KPC Medical College for treatment, where he died on Thursday at 4:30 a.m.`,

The officer said the first-year student was summoned to the main accused's room and was made to "write a letter." Over the course of the night, the minor was taken to three different rooms and allegedly ragged. He further added: "The letter was then written by two seniors. One of the main accused claimed that the signature on the letter was that of the deceased minor student. However, we have our doubts about it. The letter-writing exercise started around 10 p.m." <br/>The officer further said that his seniors allegedly told him "he was gay" and asked him to "submit evidence to prove it.” “Some residents of the hostel have said that the 17-year-old told them that he was not gay. What provoked him to say so is now the focus of our investigation.”<br/>"At first, he was asked to wear only a towel. He was then asked to take the towel off, parade, and run through the balcony naked," the officer added.`,

The dean claimed to have spoken with the hostel superintendent to investigate the situation. A few hours later, the Superintendent reported finding a body lying in a pool of blood.

The institution must answer for this grave negligence.<br/>Moreover, Swapnodeep's distressing phone call to his mother highlights the need for mental health support within universities.<br/>The incident's link to toxic masculinity and peer pressure underscores the necessity of creating an environment where students feel safe and accepted, regardless of their sexual orientation.<br/>Jadavpur University and other institutions nationwide should implement sensitization programs to educate students about the consequences of ragging and the importance of empathy and respect. Change begins with education, and it's high time we prevent such incidents from happening in the first place. <br/>Our opinion is that this entire incident is deeply disturbing, and it's a call for educational institutions nationwide to take action, prioritize student well-being, and put an end to the culture of campus ragging. <br/>What the 17-year-old child must have passed through is shocking and heartbreaking. The youth these days have become so heartless that they don’t even feel the pain and ordeal the other person passes through. This is an organized crime and should be dealt with severely. An exemplary punishment should be given to the accused.`,

"We elected two film stars as MPs many times, but they could not even build a cinema hall for us." They say they won't. Travel anywhere else to watch 'Gadar 2'. Sunny had visited Sri Darbar Sahib in Amritsar to promote Gadar 2 but did not visit Gurdaspur, his Lok Sabha constituency located only 30 km away. This also led to locals getting upset with their MP.<br/>Residents claim that Sunny Deol has failed to represent Gurdaspur's concerns in the Lok Sabha and has not contributed to the town's development. They believe that if he can portray the hero on screen, he should also work as a hero for the people who elected him. This sentiment has led to a boycott of his film in Gurdaspur.<br/>"Sunny Deol has failed to empathize with the struggles of Gurdaspur, and he should resign from his position as an MP and focus solely on his film career," another Gurdaspur resident said. In July, Gurdaspur residents said their MP Sunny Deol didn't visit the constituency and had undertaken no development work there. They said they regretted electing him as their MP. “People have been facing many difficulties in Gurdaspur, but Sunny never comes here," a Gurdaspur resident said.<br/>In 2020, 'missing' posters of Sunny Deol were seen near the railway station in Pathankot.

It's time to consider whether politics should be a genuine platform for public service rather than a means to recover from career setbacks. It's time we demand more from our elected leaders and ensure that their service truly benefits the nation.<br/>Ultimately, it's essential to remember that serving the nation as an MP is a serious responsibility, not a mere game or experiment. Celebrities entering politics should take it seriously, and voters should hold them accountable. Let's hope this incident serves as a wake-up call for celebrities and political parties. Our democracy deserves more than just absentee MPs and empty promises.<br/>To share your opinion on this issue, click on the image below:`,

The controversy surrounding the G20 budget is a classic case of misinformation leading to misguided criticism. The government's investment in long-term infrastructure development is an essential step towards progress, not merely a show-off. As India holds the G20 presidency for the year 2023, the impact of this geopolitical event will extend far beyond the immediate moment, benefiting the country in the coming years and decades.

It's a question that demands an answer not just from law enforcement but from society as a whole. Ms Kandula's family is deeply distressed by the revelations. Her grandfather told NDTV that the family had not recovered from the loss, and the policeman's behavior worsened it. "How can anyone speak like that after a tragic accident?" he asked. We must advocate for transparency, accountability, and a commitment to uphold the sanctity of every human life. Jaahnavi's tragic loss reminds us that every life is precious and no one should be reduced to a mere statistic. This incident should spark a broader conversation about the value we place on human life and the need for systemic change within law enforcement.`,

BJP Rajya Sabha MP Naresh Bansal also pitched the proposal during the recently concluded monsoon session in the Upper House, saying that the name 'India' is a symbol of "colonial slavery" and "should be removed from the Constitution". “The British changed Bharat's name to India. Under Article 1, the Constitution states: 'India, that is Bharat'. Our country has been known by the name 'Bharat' for thousands of years ... it is this country's ancient name and is found in ancient Sanskrit texts. The name 'India' was given by the colonial Raj and is thus a symbol of slavery. The name India should be removed from the Constitution," ANI had quoted the Rajya Sabha MP as saying.<br/>“I have always believed a name should be one which instills pride in us. We are Bhartiyas, India is a name given by the British & it has been long overdue to get our original name ‘Bharat’ back officially,” wrote former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag in a post.<br/>Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan also showed his support and shared a picture of the G20 invite.`,

Bharat, rooted in Indian culture, has always held sentimental value for many.<br/>The name Bharat is ancient. It has Sanskrit origins and is found in the Rig Veda and Puranas. It is also said to be derived from the name of Dushyanta’s son, Bharata of Mahabharata. History forces change, and the names do evolve and change over time. So, ‘Bharat’ was substituted by ‘India’ by the travelers and invaders coming from the west. During the Mughal period, the use of the word ‘Hindustan’ was a natural progression. And the British rulers who came to the ‘Indies’ of the east, gave it the name ‘India’. India was perceived as more neutral, potentially making it easier for the British to establish and maintain control.<br/>The term ‘Bharat’ has the sentimental appeal for us that ‘India’ lacks, and so we have the Indian army has the most-used battle cry of ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’. It is also the slogan that comes as a fitting finale to any cultural event in the country.`,

For centuries, before foreign invasions, this land was known as "Bharat Bhumi," "Bharat Varsh," or simply "Bharat." This name has deep historical significance, being named after the ancient king Bharat. Adopting "Bharat" as the official name will help preserve and showcase our rich cultural heritage.<br/><strong className="font-medium text-neutral-800">2. National Unity:</strong> The name ‘Bharat’ has historical significance and is mentioned in the Indian Constitution as an alternative name for India. Using it might promote a sense of national unity and pride.<br/><strong className="font-medium text-neutral-800">3. Decolonization:</strong> Changing the name from ‘India’ to ‘Bharat’ can be seen as a symbolic move towards decolonization and shedding remnants of the colonial era.<br/><strong className="font-medium text-neutral-800">4. Promoting Indian Languages:</strong> ‘Bharat’ is a name that is widely used in various Indian languages. Embracing this name may encourage the use of indigenous languages and promote linguistic diversity.`,

This can be a costly and time-consuming process.<br/><strong className="font-medium text-neutral-800">2. Economic Costs:</strong> Rebranding can lead to economic costs for businesses and organizations that have to update their branding, marketing materials, and products.<br/><strong className="font-medium text-neutral-800">3.

Amending the constitution is a complex and time-consuming process that involves legal, political, and administrative challenges.<br/><strong className="font-medium text-neutral-800">4. Implications for Online Identity:</strong> Renaming India to Bharat could disrupt the online identity of Indian businesses and entities. The current domain extension ".in" may need to change to ".bh," creating potential confusion and complications in the digital realm. This shift would require substantial adjustments and may impact the online visibility and branding of Indian entities, adding another layer of complexity to the name change debate.<br/><strong className="font-medium text-neutral-800">5. Global Recognition:</strong> India is a well-recognized name internationally, and changing it to ‘Bharat’ might lead to confusion and difficulties in terms of global recognition and diplomacy.<br/><strong className="font-medium text-neutral-800">6. Linguistic Diversity:</strong> While ‘Bharat’ is widely used in many Indian languages, there are still numerous languages and dialects spoken across the country. Some groups may feel that their linguistic identity is not adequately represented by this name.<br/><strong className="font-medium text-neutral-800">7. Symbolic Nature:</strong> Some may argue that changing the name is a symbolic gesture and that more substantial efforts should be focused on addressing pressing issues like poverty, healthcare, education, and governance.`,
