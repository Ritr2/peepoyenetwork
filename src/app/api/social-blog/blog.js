What happened to these students is inhumane.<br/>A video of the incident spread quickly on social media, leading to outrage and concern among people. Many expressed their sadness and frustration about how the children were treated and demanded action to prevent similar incidents in the future. This incident shows that, in the race to show their power, some individuals will not hesitate to mistreat even young children. Schools and authorities must prioritize the safety and comfort of students, especially in such extreme weather conditions.<br/>Despite the video going viral, there was no immediate response from the minister or local authorities. People are calling for accountability and quick action to address this concerning situation.`,

It's important to note that he was referring to the way he talks, not the entire Haryanavi language.

Salman seemed to use nationalism while comparing the elvish fanbase with the Indian army. However, this comparison doesn't consider that calling fans an "army" is just a way to show their support, similar to how actors take on different roles in movies without actually being those characters.`,

Or do they have the courage to do the same with Pooja by calling her father and scolding her for her upbringing comments? Of course, they probably won't do it with their Bollywood gang because their main goal is to attract attention from the audience, whether it's through positive or negative means, just to stay in the spotlight.<br/>What do you think?`,

People can easily be swayed to believe anything. When we receive any news, we should always verify it with more than one reliable source.<br/>The lack of media responsibility in verifying news and providing non-provocative information also adds fuel to the fire.

        p: `During the second sawari of Baba Mahakal in Ujjain, some mischievous people climbed on the rooftop of a building and began spitting down below as the Mahakal Sawari passed on the street near Tanki Chowraha. This disrespectful and offensive act continued even after devotees warned them to stop. Shockingly, some people at the event recorded videos of the culprits spitting and shared them on social media platforms.<br/>As the videos went viral, officials from the Vishva Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal were deeply angered by the offensive act and protested at the police station. The authorities responded by registering a case against the accused individuals involved in this unacceptable behavior.<br/>Such actions of disrespect and insensitivity are deeply disheartening and should not be tolerated in any community. The Mahakal Sawari is a sacred event, and everyone should show respect during such religious processions. We must remember that we live in a diverse society where people from different faiths and beliefs coexist. It is crucial to have respect and tolerance among all community members. Acts of disrespect and provocation can only lead to tension and disharmony.`,
