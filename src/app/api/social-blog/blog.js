    summary: `Recently, Carryminati, the popular YouTuber, uploaded a roast video targeting the contestants of the previous season of Bigg Boss, including the host Salman Khan. The video was intended purely for humour, without any personal attacks. However, during the course of the video, Carryminati also made fun of MC Stan, which didn't sit well with Stan's fans. This led to a heated exchange of opinions between Stan's fans and Carryminati's fans. In this blog, we’ll discuss and understand the difference in the fan's perspectives.`,

        p: `CarryMinati's videos are known for their amazing roasts and humorous content. In his latest roast video, he targeted the contestants of Bigg Boss and even took a jab at the show's host, Salman Khan. As MC Stan, the winner of Bigg Boss Season 16, was also one of the contestants, Carry took him on in his roast. In his video, CarryMinati mocked MC Stan's appearance by saying how he took his whole wealth with him everywhere and referred to him as 'Kuposit Bappi Lahiri' Additionally, CarryMinati also took a snap on despite being given very little screen time, MC Stan still come up as the winner of the show.<br/>However, MC Stan's fans didn't like it at all and started sharing their opinions on the internet. It's important to understand that roasting is a common form of comedy, and its purpose is to entertain the audience, not to attack someone personally. CarryMinati's intention was to tickle the funny bone of his viewers, and that should be perceived as such. Although fans of both parties have the right to express their emotions too.`,

This tragic incident, considered one of India's worst railway disasters of the century, resulted in the loss of 275 lives and left over 1,000 individuals injured, many with severe wounds. As the shock and sadness spread across the entire country, questions are being raised about the factors that led to this calamity. Early investigations indicate that a problem with the signals, possibly caused by changes in the electronic system, might have played a role in the terrible crash. But is it the root cause?`,

Three trains were involved in the tragic collision: the Coromandel Express, which was en route from Shalimar railway station to Chennai; the Howrah Superfast Express, which departed from Yesvantpur station in Bengaluru and was heading to Howrah; and a stationary goods train. While the exact sequence of events leading to the crash is still under investigation, initial reports suggest that the Coromandel Express derailed first, setting off a chain reaction that resulted in the collision.`,

        h2: false,
        p: `An interlocking system plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety and smooth operation of trains at railway junctions, stations, and signalling points. One of the key functions of the interlocking system is to ensure that the points, which are movable sections of the track allowing trains to switch tracks, are correctly aligned and locked before a train can pass over them. Additionally, track circuits, which are electrical circuits installed on the track, help detect the presence of trains. They provide information about whether a particular section of track is occupied or vacant, enabling the interlocking system to regulate train movements accordingly.<br/>Electronic interlocking is an advanced system that uses software and electronic parts to control and monitor train movements. According to the rail minister, a modification in the electronic interlocking system might have caused wrong signals or incorrect directions. As a result, the Coromandel Express, travelling at high speed of over 120kmph, ended up on a side track instead of the main line. Tragically, it collided with a stationary goods train parked there.`,

It's important to remember that respect and acceptance are values that lie at the core of every religion.

The film's team, led by Om Raut and Manoj Muntashir, has displayed arrogance and a dismissive attitude toward the sentiments of the viewers. Instead of honoring the epic tale that holds deep cultural and religious significance, they have chosen to prioritize monetary gains and mass-market appeal.<br/>Their disregard for the accuracy and integrity of the original story is evident in the numerous mistakes, fallacies, and distortions present in the movie. By altering key aspects of the narrative, misrepresenting characters, and introducing absurd elements, the filmmakers have not only disrespected the epic Ramayana and Ramcharitmanas, but they have also disappointed millions of Indians who hold this epic in high regard. They should apologize to all Indians because what they have done in the name of creativity is pathetic.<br/>What do you think?`,

The remaining 40 seats are unreserved general constituencies, of which 39 were won by Meitei candidates in the last election. This lopsided representation has led to complaints from tribal groups, who feel that government spending and development are disproportionately concentrated in the Meitei-dominated Imphal Valley. The Meiteis make up 53% of the state's population.<br/>Adding to the complexities, the Land Reform Act of Manipur restricts Meiteis from settling in the hilly regions without the permission of the local district councils. This measure aims to protect the interests of the tribal communities and preserve their traditional way of life.`,

The Kuki community was alarmed by this directive, as it feared that granting ST status to the Meiteis would allow them to purchase land in the prohibited hilly areas, leading to potential encroachment on tribal territories.

        In protest against the state government's actions, the tribal groups called for a total shutdown on April 28, 2023. The situation escalated as a mob set fire to the gym where Chief Minister N. Biren Singh was scheduled to inaugurate, resulting in vandalism and destruction of property. To control the escalating situation, Section 144 (of the Criminal Procedure Code) was imposed, and a five-day internet shutdown was enforced.<br/>The confrontation between protesters and the police led to clashes, with the authorities using tear gas shells to disperse the mobs. The violence further intensified on May 3, when the All Tribal Student Union Manipur (ATSUM) called for a "Tribal Solidarity March" in Churachandpur district, which turned violent.<br/>Amidst the unrest, the mostly Kuki tribal population in non-tribal areas faced attacks on their residences and churches. Even a Kuki MLA, Vunzjagin Valte of the BJP, who represented the tribal headquarters of Churachandpur, was attacked during the riots while returning from the state secretariat. To control the situation, the Manipur government issued a "shoot at sight" order on May 4, 2023.`,

True education, however, extends beyond the confines of a classroom. It involves acquiring expertise on specific topics and gaining hands-on experience in one's professional domain. Such education enriches the decision-making process with practical knowledge and problem-solving abilities.<br/>Politics demands a deep understanding of socioeconomic challenges, cultural dynamics, and historical contexts. Ironically, Kajol critiqued leaders without educational backgrounds when she herself is a school dropout. While education is undoubtedly valuable, it is not the sole indicator of a leader's competence.<br/>There are many examples of individuals who didn’t receive any formal education but still have real-life experiences that make them great in their respective fields.`,

This incident shows that, in the race to show their power, some individuals will not hesitate to mistreat even young children.

People are calling for accountability and quick action to address this concerning situation.`,

Salman seemed to use nationalism while comparing the elvish fanbase with the Indian army.

Or do they have the courage to do the same with Pooja by calling her father and scolding her for her upbringing comments? Of course, they probably won't do it with their Bollywood gang because their main goal is to attract attention from the audience, whether it's through positive or negative means, just to stay in the spotlight.<br/>What do you think?`,

        p: `During the second sawari of Baba Mahakal in Ujjain, some mischievous people climbed on the rooftop of a building and began spitting down below as the Mahakal Sawari passed on the street near Tanki Chowraha. This disrespectful and offensive act continued even after devotees warned them to stop. Shockingly, some people at the event recorded videos of the culprits spitting and shared them on social media platforms.<br/>As the videos went viral, officials from the Vishva Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal were deeply angered by the offensive act and protested at the police station. The authorities responded by registering a case against the accused individuals involved in this unacceptable behavior.<br/>Such actions of disrespect and insensitivity are deeply disheartening and should not be tolerated in any community. The Mahakal Sawari is a sacred event, and everyone should show respect during such religious processions. We must remember that we live in a diverse society where people from different faiths and beliefs coexist. It is crucial to have respect and tolerance among all community members. Acts of disrespect and provocation can only lead to tension and disharmony.`,
